Blockchain Explained: Fundamentals of Blockchain Technology
About Me

I am an independent blockchain researcher focused on interpreting cutting-edge blockchain technology from the perspective of technology and business. Currently, I have accumulated over 100,000 followers across various Chinese media platforms, including Twitter, Substack, and Binance Square, with exposure of tens of millions for my professional technical analyses. I am recognized as a social influencer in the field.

My media channels have published over a hundred professional articles that aim to simplify abstract and complex technical concepts, helping a broader audience to understand the intricate logic behind blockchain technology, thereby enabling them to better identify quality projects.

 Key Areas of Focus

- Layer 1 public chains
- Layer 2 (DA, RaaS, Stack, etc.)
- Modularization
- Chain abstraction
- Relay protocols (AVS)
- AI + DePIN
- ZK (zkVM, zk Coprocessor)
- DeFi (governance, composable arbitrage)
- BTCFi (AVM, RGB, Lightning Network)
- Other cutting-edge technologies, including FHE and Blind Compute

Contributions

Since the launch of OP Stack, I have written a series of articles covering various aspects, including the commercial landing of OP Stack, interpretations of partnerships, technical practice upgrades, and visions for the future of Superchain. As a social influencer, I aim to showcase the driving value of OP Stack in the Ethereum Layer 2 market while discussing issues like Fraud Proof and centralized Sequencers.

In Retro 6, I believe I have provided valuable insights and research content for OP Stack during every technological upgrade, market collaboration, and governance design process.
